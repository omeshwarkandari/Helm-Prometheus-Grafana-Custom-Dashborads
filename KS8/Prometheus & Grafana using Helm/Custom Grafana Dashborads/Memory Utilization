We have created the Four graphs in a Single Panel by runing four queries as mentioned below:-

1. Used memory by a Node by subtracting Cached Memory, Buffer Memory and Free Memory from the Total Available Memory.
i.e. Used Memory = Total Memory - Free Memory - Cached Memory - Buffer Memory

2. Free Memory i.e. Avaialble to use after current utilization.

3. Cached memory: RAM is used as cache (pages with actual contents of files or block devices).

4. Buffer Memory:  It is a portion of the total memory that is set aside as a temporary holding place for data that is being sent to or received from an external devices
such as a HDD, keyboard or printer and used for the file system metadata.

Query A: Used memory
node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}-node_memory_Cached_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}-node_memory_MemFree_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}-node_memory_Buffers_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}
Add Legend: Used, Graph: Time series with Y-asix Unit:bytes(IEC) to change Bustes into GB units.

Query B: cached Memory
node_memory_Cached_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}
Add Legend: Cached

Query C: Free Memory
node_memory_MemFree_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}
aAdd Legend: Free

Query D: Buffer Memory
node_memory_Buffers_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}
Add Legend: Buffer

Save the Panel with an appropriate heading e.g. "Memory Use Node-1"
