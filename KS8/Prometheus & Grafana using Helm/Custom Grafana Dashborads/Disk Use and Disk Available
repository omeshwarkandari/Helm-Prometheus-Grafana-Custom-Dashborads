Disk Utlization:
We will Create two seperate Panels one each for Used Disk Space and Available Disk Space.

Graph 1: Used Disk Space
Query1: Total Disk by excluding the disk used by tmp, virtual machines etc.
node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints",device!~"/dev/loop.*",device!~"tmpfs | nsfs",device!="gvfsd-fuse"}
Query2: Available as free to use
node_filesystem_avail_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}

Used Disk Space = (Total Disk Space - Available Disk Space)

node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints",device!~"/dev/loop.*",device!~"tmpfs | nsfs",device!="gvfsd-fuse"}-node_filesystem_avail_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints"}
Add the Legend: {{device}} because we want only the devices to be shown
Add the Graph: TimeSeries with Unit:bytes(IEC) in the Y-axis so that it shwos metrics in GB.
Save and name it e.g. "Used Disk Space Node-1"




Graph 2: Available Disk Space
node_filesystem_avail_bytes{instance="172.31.82.223:9100",job="kubernetes-service-endpoints",device!~"/dev/loop.*",device!~"tmpfs | nsfs",device!="gvfsd-fuse"}
Add the Graph: TimeSeries with Unit:bytes(IEC) in the Y-axis so that it shwos metrics in GB.
Save and name it e.g. "Available Disk Space Node-1"


Note:
/dev/loop* are loop devices making plain files accessible as block devices. They are typically used for mounting disk images.
e.g. /dev/loop0 ---> Ubuntu Image and  /dev/loop1 ---> Docket Image

Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all of its files in virtual memory. 
Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on your hard drive. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is lost.

GVFSD is the daemon process for GVFS, the GNOME Virtual File System (or possibly it's predecessor, GnomeVFS).
It's a GNOME component that handles filesystem automounting when you're logged into the GNOME-based Ubuntu desktop. 
This includes devices like USB thumb drives and external HDDs, optical discs (CD/DVD), Samba or NFS or SSHFS network mounts, and other useful userspace filesystems.
