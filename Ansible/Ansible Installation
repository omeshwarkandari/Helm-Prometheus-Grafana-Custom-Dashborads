Ansible Envionment:
Part1: Install and configure Ansible Server
1. Build an EC2 Machine with SSH Port open e.g. Amzon EC2 system.
2. Create a user e.g. ansible admin (ansadmin) with sudo access, password authentication enabled. This user will have privelege to SSH into remote hosts using its public key.
3. Login as root ( sudo su -)
4. Craete user:  useradd ansadmin
5. Create password: passwd ansadmin
6. add user to use sudo command by editing sudoers file:  vi /etc/sudoers  or  visudo (late is recommended): add command " ansadmin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL " 
 {
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ansadmin        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL 
 }

7. Enable Password authentication: vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  (comment out "PasswordAuthentication yes" and comment in "PasswordAuthentication no")
{
  # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  #PermitEmptyPasswords no
  #PasswordAuthentication no
}
8. Reload the service sshd by restarting the sshd daemon so that it does not exit on changing user or system restart.
RHEL/CENTOS - sudo systemctl restart sshd.service (Ubuntu/Debian - systemctl restart ssh.service) &  service sshd reload 
{
 # systemctl restart sshd.service
 [root@ip-172-31-94-236 ~]# service sshd reload
 Redirecting to /bin/systemctl reload sshd.service
}
9. Check the password authentication by connecting the Server without user name and keypair in mobaxterm by just entering ip into remote host and click ok, which will prompt:
login as: ansadmin
ansadmin@54.165.210.110's password:
10. Install ansible: yum install ansible and it might redirect to link for ansible installation
11. Login as ansadmin and verify pwd is /home/ansadmin
12. Generate SSH Keypair:  ssh-keygen to generate private & public key. We will copy public key into hosts so that ansadmin from ansible server can manage host systems.
13. Also verify the content of /etc/ansible/ which should be " ansible.cfg  hosts  roles "

Part2: Install Hosts
1. Prepare a host system e.g. RHEL EC2 System
2. Login as root user & Create a user (User & Password should be same as craeted in Ansible Server)
3. Add user to sudoers: visudo and shift+G will lead to the end of the file where we can add "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
(Note: In RHEL system an entry for ec2-user is observed at the end of file but not seen in Amazon-linux system probably ec2-user is built-in.)
4. Enable Passworh auth: vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config, sudo systemctl restart ssh.service  & service sshd reload 

Part3: Copy Public Key of user ansadmin from ansible server to user ansadmin in hosts.
1. Login to Ansible Server as ansadmin: cd .ssh/ and copy the public key in the remote host using below command:
"ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<private-ip=address of remote host system>" which will ask for confirmation as well as verify the success by "ssh ansadmin@<ip of the host system>"
2. Success to ssh menas ansadmin user can manage remote host envionment using Ansible Playbooks.

Part4: Add system to /etc/ansible/hosts file, test ping connection and run the playbooks.
1. test the connectivity between Ansible Server and hosts: "anisble all -m ping"
2. Create a playbook e.g. install.yml to install the software packages
3. Verify the playbook: " ansible-playbook install.yml --check" or "ansible-playbook install.yml -C"
4. Run the playbook: "ansible-playbook install.yml"
5. Login the host system and verify the installation of the software packages.

Key Note: Difference between " Service sshd restart and reload"
Generally speaking, restart will terminate the service in question and restart it; reload will only reload the configuration file.
Since reload only reloads the config, it will cause less disruption to existing activities and currently open connections; users might not even notice that it was run. 
However, depending on what server we're talking about, some options may not be changeable using reload; and if the server is using too much memory, etc,
it may be necessary to use restart to force it to start from a clean slate.
