- name: Ansible playbook to run httpd with Notify & handlers
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd on RHEL Servers
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: installed
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: start httpd services
    - name: install httpd on DEBIAN Servers
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
    - copy:
        src: /home/ansadmin/playbook/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html

  handlers:
    - name: start httpd services
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started



Note: Whenever we run this playbbok irrespective of what the httpd service will restart whoch might trigger service outage.
      To avoid this we introduce notify and handlers where the cript in handler will execute only when notified.
      This way we can avoid restart for running httpd and trigger restart if its fresh install or change in configuration
