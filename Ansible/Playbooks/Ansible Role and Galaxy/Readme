Ansible Galaxy: Galaxy is a repository to create Ansible Role.
Role: Role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files to make playbook simple & re-usable.

e.g. Create a setup for installing xyz asset.
[ansadmin@ansible-server playbook]$ ansible-galaxy init xyz_setup
- Role xyz_setup was created successfully, which will create a role for each component like tasks, handlers, files, defaults, vars of an ansible playbooks in a
tree structure to make it re-usable across multi-projects.
$ ls xyz_setup/
defaults  files  handlers  meta  README.md  tasks  templates  tests  vars

e.g. lets set up a role for tomcat server installation and copy the respective tasks/variables of the playbook tomcatprodsetup2.yml into roles created.
It has two parts first create role using Ansible Galaxy to store the mutlipe ansible files and a yml file to play the playbook e.g. tomcat_role.yml

Part1: Create a Role
$ ansible-galaxy init tomcat_setup
$ ls tomcat_setup/
defaults  files  handlers  README.md  tasks  vars (we have  " removed meta templates  test " as not using at the moment)
$ ls tomcat_setup/tasks/
main.yml  
(A role will have a built-in main.yml where we copy respective modules e.g. we copy all the modules under tasks of tomcatprodsetup2.yml into /tomcat_setup/tasks/main.yml,
handlers task inside /tomcat_setup/handlers/main.yml, content of tomcat_vars.yml isnide /tomcat_setup/vars/main.yml, files like server.xml inside /tomcat_setup/files and variables
which are of lower priority or generally do not change are kept insdie /tomcat_setup/defaults/main.yml).

Part2: Create a yml file to play the playbook
$ nano tomcat_role.yml
This file will have the header part of the tomcatprodsetup2.yml as well as a taks called "roles" which calls the different files of the setup e.g "tomcat_setup".
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts tomcat_role.yml --limit webservers

we have limited the tomcat deployment to webservers based on the "hosts" file configuration where we are using 172.31.94.236 as tomcat server.
$ cat playbook/hosts

[webservers]
172.31.94.236
# 172.31.87.28

[debianservers]
172.31.84.168

localhost
