## pre-requisites
1. An Artifactory server [Click here to setup](https://youtu.be/eB6CDSR8VCA)
1. A Jenkins Server [Click here to setup](https://youtu.be/M32O4Yv0ANc)

## Integration Steps
Login to Jenkins to integrate Artifactory with Jenkins  

1. Install "Artifactory" plug-in   
- `Manage Jenkins` -> `Jenkins Plugins` -> `available` -> `artifactory`

2. Configure Artifactory server credentials   
- ` Manage Jenkins` -> `Configure System` -> `Artifactory`
   - Artifactory Servers
      - Server ID : `Artifactory-Server`
      - URL : `Artifactory Server URL`
      e.g http://ec2-54-165-178-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/artifactory or http://public dns-name:8081/artifactory
      also ensure that this url is reflected in the advance section of the settings, 
      Note : it is observed that when runing Test Connection the result was "Found Artifactory 0.0.0 on http://ec2-54-165-178-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/artifactory"
      while the correct result should be "Found Artifactory 6.9.6 on http://ec2-54-165-178-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/artifactory" and it was observed that the url in the
      Advanced Artifactory configuration was having additonal parameter artifactory added "http://ec2-54-165-178-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/artifactory/artifactory"
      so this needs to be corrected as "http://ec2-54-165-178-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/artifactory"
      - Username : `admin`
      - Password : `admin@123
